<h2>Whats Screen64?</h2>
<p>Screen64 is a way to share your screen, instead of uploading your screenshot to the internet, we encode it in base64 which allows it to be transferred through text, which means that we don't know what your taking a screenshot of. </p>
<h2>Why Screen64?</h2>
<p>Our application does not transfer any info to our servers and instead of having a background process running at all times which would be costly for RAM, we use shortcut keys. This is a built in feature of Windows that allows for keyboard shortcuts to start a program. </p>
<h2>Whats Base64?</h2>
<p>Base64 is a way to encode data so that it is represented by characters, it has 64 values: a-z, A-Z, +, / with = as padding. For example:</p>
<p>The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.</p>
<p>Would be:</p>

<h2>The downside of using Screen64</h2>
<p>The problem of encoding images into base64 is that the encoded data ia very long and very impractical to share in an chatroom.</p>
<h2>How to use Screen64</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, Screen64 uses absolutly no ram unless you are taking a screenshot. When you open screen64 for the first time, you will find a dialog asking for a shortcut key, this key combanation will be what you press to use Screen64, once you set the key combanation, a shortcut will appear on your desktop named Screen64 and you can open it or press the key comabanation to start the app up. Every time you do so, your screen will be captured and will it will be encoded in Base64 and copied to your clipboard.</p>
